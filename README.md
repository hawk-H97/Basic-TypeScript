# TypeScript
## Welcome to the Basic-TypeScript wiki!

Why we are using TypeScript instead of JavaScript? 
It allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match. For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.

Some topics we are going to see in TypeScipt,
## 1. Annotation:
Annotations are used to specify the data type of a variable, parameter, function return value and other types of value. 
Annotations help developers catch errors early in development by allowing them to specify what types of values can be assigned
to a given variable or passed as a argument to a function.

String, number, boolean
// let myVar: type = value()
console.log(myVar)
